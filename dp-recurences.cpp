//Partition Problem
Let isSubsetSum(arr, n, sum/2) be the function that returns true if 
there is a subset of arr[0..n-1] with sum equal to sum/2

The isSubsetSum problem can be divided into two subproblems
 a) isSubsetSum() without considering last element 
    (reducing n to n-1)
 b) isSubsetSum considering the last element 
    (reducing sum/2 by arr[n-1] and n to n-1)
If any of the above the above subproblems return true, then return true.

//Coin Change
To count the total number of solutions, we can divide all set solutions into two sets.
1) Solutions that do not contain mth coin (or Sm).
2) Solutions that contain at least one Sm.
Let count(S[], m, n) be the function to count the number of solutions, then it can be written as sum of count(S[], m-1, n) and count(S[], m, n-Sm).
